# Initiative
Tool for D&amp;D rpg. It will help the DM to organize players and npcs; especially during fights

# Some more info
As you can see, I'm a D&amp;D fan and I made tons of tools to simplify, help or just show the game. This is one of them. This is one of the simpliest, the DM will have every player or npc initiative on the screen; a big arrow will show the guy who is playing in that moment. Every entry in the screen will have an initiative modifier and a roll 1-20 automatically calculated. Everything will be sorted from the higher initiative to the lowest one, but they can be manually re-arranged by the DM.

PS: I probably was drunk when I drawn the GUI, look at that red squares! lol
